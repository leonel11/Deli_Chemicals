        Periodic Table of Elements (Mendeleev's table) - classification of chemical elements, 
        which establishes the dependence of various properties of the elements of the charge of the atomic nucleus. 
        The system is a graphic expression of the periodic law, established by the Russian chemist Mendeleev. 
        It's original version was developed by Mendeleev in the 1869-1871 years, and established the dependence of 
        properties of elements to their atomic weight (in the modern, from the atomic mass). 
        Total variants suggested several hundred images of the periodic system (analytical curves, tables, geometric shapes, etc.). 
        In the modern version of the system is assumed mixing elements in the two-dimensional table in which each column (group) 
        defines the basic physical and chemical properties, and the rows represent periods to a certain extent similar to each other. 
        Periodic system of Mendeleev was a milestone in the development of the atomic - molecular theory. 
        Thanks to her, had the modern concept of the chemical elements have been refined notions of simple substances and compounds. 
        The predictive role of the periodic system, shown by another Mendeleev in the XX century was manifested in the evaluation of 
        chemical properties of transuranic elements. Developed in the XIX century. within the science of chemistry, the periodic table 
        was finished ordering of types of atoms for new areas of physics, which have developed in the early XX century. Atomic physics
         and nuclear physics. Studies atom physics methods, it was found that the serial number of the element in the periodic table 
         (atomic number) is a measure of the electric charge of the atomic core of this element, the horizontal row number (period) 
         in the table determines the number of electron shells of atoms, and the number of vertical rows - quantum structure upper shell, 
         what elements of the series and similarity of chemical properties are required. The appearance of the periodic system has opened
          a new, genuinely scientific era in the history of chemistry and related sciences series - instead of disparate information about
           the elements and compounds appeared orderly system on which it became possible to generalize, draw conclusions, predict.
